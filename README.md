- **Explore Modern Web Development**: Implement responsive designs, state management, and component-driven architecture.
- **Learn Best Practices**: Apply clean code, accessibility standards, and modular design principles.

## üìÇ Repository Contents

- **/src**: Source files for the main ReactJS project, including components, styles, and assets.
- **/public**: Static assets like images, fonts, and the main `index.html`.
- **HTML Files**: Standalone HTML files for smaller exercises or prototypes.
- **CSS Files**: Custom stylesheets, including advanced CSS techniques and frameworks like Tailwind CSS.
- **JavaScript (ReactJS)**: React components, hooks, and state management for dynamic functionality.
- **Main Project**: A complete web application (e.g., a task manager, e-commerce site, or portfolio) showcasing integrated HTML, CSS, and ReactJS.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To dive into this front-end hub:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SumitBiniYadav/HTML.git
   ```
2. **Set Up the React Environment**:

   - Navigate to the repository folder:
     ```bash
     cd HTML
     ```
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Start the development server:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
   - Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view the main project.

3. **Explore HTML/CSS Files**:
   - Open standalone `.html` files in a browser to view static prototypes.
   - Inspect `.css` files for advanced styling techniques.

4. **Experiment**:
   - Modify React components in `/src` to test new features.
   - Use browser developer tools to debug and enhance the UI/UX.
